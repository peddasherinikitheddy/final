 Accessible(?) and responsive tabs.
Html and Css only (No JS).

To do:

* Verify accessibility. Problems / solutions?<br/>
* Verify browser compatibility. Currently tested on:<br/>
  - Chrome 34 (Linux), Chrome 36 (Android/Windows).<br/>
  - Firefox 27, 29, 31 (Windows / Linux).<br/>
  - Internet Explorer 11.<br/>
  - Opera 12 (Windows).<br/>

Features:

* No JavaScript required.<br/>
* Flexible. Stretches with the surrounding space and the tab content.<br/>
* Can handle multiple tabgroups and nested tabgroups.<br/>
* Retains correct tab order, between tabs and content, as well as the surrounding.<br/>
* Tabs can be navigated by using the arrow keys:<br/>
  - left / up - moves left / up.<br/>
  - right / down - moves right / down.<br/>
* Responsive. Switches between standard/left tabs and the stacked full width tabs, at a specified viewport width.<br/>
* If there are many tabs or very long tab captions, in large screen mode the standard tabs break off in multiple rows if there is not enough of space.<br/>
